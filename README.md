CSC-60
Introduction to Systems Programming in UNIX.

Topics Covered
- C Preprocessor Macros
Using #define, #ifdef, and #ifndef for conditional compilation and macro definitions.

- I/O Handling
Performing input and output operations using system calls and libraries in C.

- Bit-Manipulation
Manipulating data at the bit level with bitwise operators.

- Timesharing System Concepts
Understanding process management and resource allocation in multitasking systems.

- File Permissions
Managing file access using UNIX system calls (chmod, chown).

- Shell Script Programming
Writing and using shell scripts to automate tasks.

- Makefiles
Automating the build process with makefiles for compiling and linking.

- System Calls (Fork and Exec)
Creating new processes with fork() and executing programs with exec().

- Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation
Managing memory dynamically using malloc, free, and realloc.

- Libraries and Relocation
Using static and dynamic libraries and handling symbol tables during linking.

- Semester Deliverables
The course consisted of weekly lab deliverables.

- Testing and Documentation
Emphasis on unit testing and clear documentation to ensure the correctness and clarity of the code.

- Goals and Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, I gained hands-on experience in C systems programming, including memory management, process control, and low-level I/O. This project strengthened my skills for real-world systems programming tasks.
